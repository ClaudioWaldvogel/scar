# ![SCAR](scar-logo.png)

SCAR is a framework to transparently execute containers out of Docker images in AWS Lambda, in order to run applications (see examples for [ImageMagick](examples/imagemagick/README.md), [FFmpeg](examples/ffmpeg/README.md) and [AWS CLI](examples/aws-cli/README.md), as well as deep learning frameworks such as [Theano](examples/theano/README.md) and [Darknet](examples/darknet/README.md)) and code in virtually any programming language (see examples for [Erlang](examples/erlang) and [Elixir](examples/elixir)) on AWS Lambda.

SCAR provides the benefits of AWS Lambda with the execution environment you decide, provided as a Docker image available in Docker Hub. It is probably the easiest, most convenient approach to run generic applications on AWS Lambda, as well as code in your favourite programming language, not only in those languages supported by AWS Lambda.

SCAR also supports a High Throughput Computing [Programming Model](#programming-model) to create highly-parallel event-driven file-processing serverless applications that execute on customized runtime environments provided by Docker containers run on AWS Lambda.

A complete usage manual can be found in the [main branch of the project](https://github.com/grycap/scar).

## WARNING !!
> This branch is experimental. Use it with caution.
> The ssh functionality was created with the intention of debugging lambda functions.

## Usage

The following commands will create a lambda function that connects to the host specified using a reverse ssh connection:
```
SSH_HOST=ec2-user@25.16.235.145
SSH_PORT=7022
SSH_KEY_PATH=~/.ssh/id_rsa
CONTAINER_IMAGE=bitnami/minideb
scar init -n sshl -sh $SSH_HOST -sp $SSH_PORT -sk $SSH_KEY_PATH $CONTAINER_IMAGE
scar run sshl sleep 50000
```
* In this example we are using an ec2 machine but you can use any machine with the `SSH_PORT` open and an ssh server running.
* The `SSH_KEY_PATH` is the path to the key that lambda is going to use to create the reverse connection to your machine.
* The lambda function is launched with an sleep so the functions doesn't finish, but you can execute any script or container that scar allows. For more information check the [scar webpage](https://grycap.github.io/scar/).

To connect to lambda, in our case from the ec2 machine you have to execute:
```
ssh -p 7022 scar@localhost
scar@localhost's password:
Welcome to Lambda Shell!
Î» >
```
* The ssh user is `scar` and the password is `lambda`.
* The shell and the ssh server are created using the [faassh](https://github.com/smithclay/faassh) library.
