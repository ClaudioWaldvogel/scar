# Usage Examples of SCAR

This directory includes different use cases of applications packaged as Docker images that can be easily executed on AWS Lambda using SCAR:

* [Cowsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay) and [Fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)), just for silly testing.
* [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/), to execute shell-scripts using this tool.
* [MrBayes](http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/), a scientific application for bayesian inference of Phylogeny.
