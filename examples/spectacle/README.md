# Generate HTML5 Documentation using Spectacle

You can generate HTML5 documentation from OpenAPI/Swagger 2.0 API specifications via [Spectacle](https://sourcey.com/spectacle/) on AWS Lambda using the docker image [sourcey/spectacle](https://hub.docker.com/r/sourcey/spectacle/).

## Usage in AWS Lambda via SCAR

You can run a container out of this image on AWS Lambda via [SCAR](https://github.com/grycap/scar) using the following procedure:

1. Create the Lambda function

```sh
scar init -f scar-spectacle.yaml
```

2. Upload a file to the S3 bucket to launch the function

```sh
scar put -b scar-spectacle/input -p swagger.json
```

3. Download the generated files from the S3 bucket

```sh
scar get -b scar-spectacle/output -p /tmp/spectacle
```
The last command creates an `output/` folder in the `/tmp/spectacle` path with the files generated by the spectacle invocation.
